Roger is a smallholder farmer in Kigoma, Rwanda where he grows coffee. Over the past five years, he has suffered significant crop damage due to unpredicted extreme weather incidents and disease outbreaks. The weather in Rwanda is becoming more and more unpredictable each year due to the effects of climate change. Left little to no crop to harvest after such a disaster, Roger has, at times, found himself struggling to provide for his family
 
Even the smallest flooding and drought events can affect smallholder farmers who account for over 80% of the world’s food supply according to the 2021 Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations report. The members of these vital communities “make up a significant portion of the world’s poor who live on less than $2 a day”. While developed countries make significant economic and social progress with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning, smallholder farmers are often left uncatered for due to poor infrastructure and financial limitations. Closing the technology gap between smallholder farmers and those in developed regions means closing the gap between actual and potential crop yields; for smallholder farmers this means food security, and the level of income necessary to rise above the poverty line. As the threat of climate change grows, so does the imperative to empower smallholder farmers to maximise their crop yields in pursuit of a sustainable future. 
 
FarmAid has the ability to equip smallholder farmers with the power of AI. Imagine this, Roger wakes up and gets alerted by our app that a storm is predicted to hit his area in 3 hours. He rushes to cover up his crops and saves the whole lot. Our solution provides an app with a simple and comprehensive user interface that allows farmers to access and benefit from AI and machine learning. For the purpose of beta testing, the AI models have been trained to service farmers, and will allow users to: 
 
* Receive alerts for any adverse weather events and provide general advice;
* Subsequent releases will take into account data inputs provided by the farmer to provide more tailored advice. 
* Take photos of leaves from their crop which will be analysed for the presence of the five most common types of coffee crop disease. 

* Subsequent releases will expand the models to other crops, and combine photo analysis with other available data to improve predictions. 
* Track their production cycle and receive AI-generated recommendations. For example; after harvest, production waste can be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms which can provide extra income, nutritional benefit, and convert the waste to usable fertilizer.  
 
FarmAid provides solutions and advice to help farmers like Roger stay one step ahead of extreme weather events and crop disease outbreaks that threaten their livelihood. FarmAid customises sustainable solutions like the above for farmers to make sure they make the best of their situation.
